# MIDI Pedal Leo


## Introduction

MIDI Pedal Leo is a foot MIDI controller based on Arduino Leonardo. For MIDI Pedal based on other Arduino compatible boards, please refer to other repositories of Gig Pedal(https://github.com/GigPedal).

Guitar players may use foot MIDI Pedal to control Guitar Amplifier/Effects Software and Hardware. This will add flexibility, convenience, and creative possibilities to their gear setups. 

Here are some common reasons why guitarists choose to incorporate MIDI Pedal into their rig:

- Eliminates the need for manual adjustments on each individual device, providing a centralized control hub for the entire rig
- Store and recall specific combinations of pedal settings or amp parameters with the press of a footswitch
- MIDI controllers can seamlessly integrate with DAWs. This integration enables synchronized control over virtual instruments, effects plugins.
- In a live performance setting, Guitarists can focus on playing instead of manually tweaking pedal settings, ensuring a smoother and more polished performance.

For other deatails about why guitar players need foot MIDI pedal, please refer to the following document in this repository's doc folder.

If you are interested in playing guitar with software such as Neural Amp Modeler and other Amp Sim application, please come to my Gig Pedal (https://gigpedal.blogspot.com/)

MIDI Pedal Leo is compatible with PC and Mac. It's plug and play, no need to install any device driver.


## Advantage of Building Your Own MIDI Controller
Building your own MIDI controller can provide a customized solution tailored to your specific needs and preferences. Here are some advantages of building your own MIDI controller:


1. Customize the controller to match your specific requirements.
2. Building your own MIDI controller can be cost-effective compared to purchasing a commercially available one.
3. Building a MIDI controller provides a hands-on learning experience.
4. Commercial MIDI controllers might not always cater to the specific gear or software you use.
5. Your MIDI controller can have a unique and personal design
6. As your needs evolve, you can easily modify or expand your DIY MIDI controller.

While building your own MIDI controller requires time, effort, and a basic understanding of electronics, it can be a rewarding project with long-term benefits, offering a unique and personalized solution for your musical needs.
