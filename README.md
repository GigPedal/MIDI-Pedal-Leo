# GPOne

GPOne is a midi controler based on Arduino. It is used to control Guitar Amp Modeler software or Digital Audio Workstation that supports midi control.

## Introduction

Guitar Amp Modeler software such as Amplitube, Guitar Rig, Bias FX, Neural Amp Modeler all support Midi contoler. When a guitar player uses these software to play guitar, he/she cannot control the software with mouse or keyboard. Therefore, a foot controler is necessary. GPOne is for this purpose.
