# Simple MIDI Pedal



Simple MIDI Pedal is a midi controller based on Arduino. It is used to control Guitar Amp Simulation software or Digital Audio Workstation that supports midi control.



## Introduction


Guitar Amp Modeler software such as Amplitube, Guitar Rig, Bias FX, Neural Amp Modeler all support Midi controller. When a guitar player uses Guitar Amp Simulation software to play guitar, he/she may have difficulties controlling the software with mouse or keyboard. Therefore, a foot controller is necessary. Simple MIDI Pedal is designed for this purpose. 

If you are interested in playing guitar with software such as Neural Amp Modeler and other Amp Sim application, please come to my Gig Pedal (https://gigpedal.blogspot.com/)

Simple MIDI Pedal is compatible with PC and Mac. It's plug and play, no need to install any device driver.


## Advantage of Building Your Own MIDI Controller


1. You can tailor the controller to your exact needs. 
2. If you need you can build controllers with up to 20 footswitches
3.  No need to install the software to setup your MIDI controller
4. Plug and Play.No need to install device drivers for your MIDI controller. 
5. Mac/PC compactable
